## What is Apple CarPlay?

CarPlay is an Apple standard that allows drivers use a limited number of apps on their iPhones safely while driving. Such apps are adapted to be manipulated by built-in touch screens, voice controls, knobs, and buttons. CarPlay is available on selected car models of many popular brands, and iPhones can be connected to Carplay via USB cord or bluetooth/Wi-Fi. In this project, we will discuss and evaluate part of the design disciplines of CarPlay apps, protocols & APIs, connection & transmission methods, and its effects on driving safety.

The lifespans of native multimedia entertainment and navigation systems on vehicles are much less than which of the vehicles themselves. With CarPlay, for instance, one can always let the navigation maps be up-to-date. CarPlay provides simplified control, like log-in free access, Siri voice control, and minimizing the number of steps to achieve certain tasks, which ensures the eyes are on the road as much as possible. CarPlay is also compatible with on-vehicle settings, via using automakers apps, to do tasks as changing the climate and loading driver profiles.
